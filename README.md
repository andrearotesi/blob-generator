# blob-generator
Who doesn't like blobs? Here, you can generate your own blob using the provided sliders. If you feel overwhelmed by the Blobs, generate a random one! After you're done tinkering with your blob, copy its CSS to use it in your web app! This project is made with plain JS, HTML &amp; CSS
